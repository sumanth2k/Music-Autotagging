# Music-Autotagging

Music auto-tagging - Multi-label classification task for song-level descriptions like genre, instrument.
We present a sample-level deep convolutional neural networks which learn representations from very small grains of waveforms (e.g. 2 or 3 samples) beyond typical frame-level input representations.
Our experiment show how this architecture with sample-level filters is capable of multi label classifications on an audio sample it encounters.
